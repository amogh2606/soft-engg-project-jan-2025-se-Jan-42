1,1,"There was an error detected in a software that has been developed and deployed. This error was fixed by the software developer. After fixing the error the developer wants to test that the whole system is working correctly, this testing is typically referred to as ______","Functional testing","Regresssion Testing","System Testing","Acceptance Testing",2
1,2,"You want to develop an Android app that contains only one button. On pressing this button the whole screen turns white if its black, and turns black if its white. Initially when the app is started the screen is white. Your job is to develop this app and test the correctness, and complete this process quickly. Choose the minimum level of testing that should be sufficient while not compromising on the correctness.","Level 0","Level 1","Level 2","Level 3",2

2,2,"Strongly connected components in control flow graphs correspond to which of the following?","Non-terminating loops.","Loop executing more than once.","All types of loops.","Nested loops",3
2,3,"Which of the following represents correct subsumption amongst structural graph coverage criteria? Read'→' as representing subsumption.","Node coverage → edge coverage → edge pair coverage.","Edge pair coverage → node coverage → edge coverage.","Prime path coverage → edge coverage.","Edge coverage → prime path coverage.",3
2,4,"Given a graph corresponding to control flow of a method, which of the options below define a reachable node","A node is said to be reachable if there is a path from any other node to that node in the graph.","A node is said to be reachable if there is a path from the initial node to that node in the graph.","A node is reachable only if it has at least two incoming edges from different node","A node is reachable if it has an outgoing edge leading to another node in the graph.",2
