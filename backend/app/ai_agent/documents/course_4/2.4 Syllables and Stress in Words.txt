[Music] i welcome you to this module today's module is titled syllables and stress and pronunciation in this module we are going to be looking at the rules of stress and celebification when we speak a word that is when we pronounce a word let's get started syllables are the unit in which a word is divided while pronouncing it and the golden rule is that every syllable has to have a vowel but not necessarily a consonant so let's look at a few words and see how many syllables these words have so let's first look at one syllable words cat by force drink walk etc are one-syllable words or monosyllabic words example of two cerebral words or die syllabic words are begin bury equal happy funny etc examples of three syllabic words are mosquito september department camera vitamin etc now examples of four-syllable words are information january american discovery and dictionary but that's not all there are words with many more syllables now let's look at syllabification let's see how many syllables these words have cat buy force drink walk so one test of celebrification is you keep your hands under your jaw and pronounce the word and see how many times your jaw drops that many syllables a word has so in this case cat by false drink walk you see my jaw drops one time every time i pronounce these words so it has one syllable look at two syllable words begin so again let's try it with the jaw drop experiment begin begin bearing berry you see my jaw drops two times so begin bury equal happy funny they are all two-syllable words now let's come to three syllables words mosquito september department camera vitamin so these are all three syllable words now coming to the four syllable words information january american dictionary discovery so for example information my jaw drops four times now an important thing that you need to look at is just ask yourself do you pronounce them do you pronounce all these syllables the same way for example january is that so no but you have an added force or a stress on one of the syllables right so we are going to next look at stress and see how a word can be pronounced with stress so what is stress syllables uttered with a greater degree of force is called a stressed syllable and the rest are called unstressed syllables the three golden rules of stress in english are first one a word can have only one stress it's the first one a word can have only one stress second one only vowels are stressed but not consonants only vowels are stressed and not consonants and what's the third rule there are many exceptions to these rules so keep these in mind and let's get started with word stress and rules now let's see how water is pronounced here the hyphen divides this word and shows how it is how many syllables it has it basically shows a celebrification and here here understand that stress applies on the syllables that are marked with bold example water here wah is elongated and said a little louder than the next syllable ter so how do you say that water the next word is people people television television together together potato potato banana banana begin began so you see the bold syllables are stressed water people television together potato banana and begin now let's see why those syllables are stressed what are the rules for finding out the stress that is applied in a word we have some rules but also keep in mind that these tools do not apply for all the words and there are lot of exceptions but a lot of these rules apply to at least 80 percent of the words in that class for example now the first rule is when you have a two syllable noun or an adjective the first syllable takes the stress for example what are those words rainy samples carton content so with the stress how do you pronounce it raining samples carton content let me repeat it again raining samples carton content now two syllable verbs and propositions take the stress on the second syllable so it is relax perceive direct among let me repeat that again relax receive direct among so as i've already said eighty percent of the two syllable words get their stress on the first syllable when it comes to two syllable nouns and adjectives whereas the second syllable takes a stress for two-syllable verbs and propositions now let's look at suffix so the first class of suffix is word ending in er or and ly so here the stress is placed on the first syllable understand that if a word ends with er or or ly then the stress is placed on the first syllable example director orderly manager let me repeat that again for you director orderly manager now suffix that's word endings with consonants and y so here when a word ends with the consonants or y then the stress is placed on the first syllable example rarity optimal gradient how do you pronounce that rarity optimal gradient now let's look at suffix that is words with different endings so suffixes such as abel arie shen shell arry gruffy el ian ebel takes the stress on the syllable right before the suffix so these suffix i'm underlining it for you all these suffix take the syllable right before the suffix now example let's look at the example able so where does the stress come so this is how it is celebified under stand a bull it's a five-syllable word and what is the suffix in this able right so what's the syllable right before the suffix it's stand so the syllable stand is stressed so how do you say that understand understandable understandable the next similarly if you see the next word is durable and the syllables are due ra and bull so able comes here and the syllable that precedes the suffix is due so you stress on do so it's durable durable okay the next word the next suffix is arry example primary diary so where does the stress come so array comes here look at this array right so now where does the syllable stress go the syllable that's right before the suffix so here it is prai and in the second word it's die so where do you stress and how do you stress and how do you pronounce it primary primary diary diary get it good the third example is examples are visible terrible again both are three syllable words right so able and there you go ebill so now where does the stress come the syllable right before the suffix so that is whis enter so it's visible visible and terrible terrible the next word the next suffix is equal example magical critical so again underline equal goes and the equal is underlined and what's the syllable preceding the suffix mag and in this case it's crit crit so how do you pronounce it magical magical critical and the final one the final suffix that we are going to look at is x example genetics pediatrics genetics is three syllable word and pediatrics is four syllable word so you see underline the x that is the suffix and look at the syllable before the suffix that is in this case in the case of genetics net and in the case of pediatrics at so how do you pronounce it genetics genetics and in second case it's pediatrics pediatrics get it good now let's look at the suffix that is words ending with ee ease ik and it so in such a case for example if the word ends with e e e is e can it the primary stress is on that suffix okay for example agree agree you see how e is elongated agree then guarantee guarantee guarantee so again this is stressed so the final syllables are stressed next asan unique or physique so how do you pronounce that unique unique physique physique the next one is prefix usually prefixes do not take stress but then there are exceptions again these prefixes are on in pre x miss and these are all so the words that starts with un in pre x and miss are all stressed in their prefix example inefficient inefficient similarly prearrange prearranged okay next is compound words that's two words coming together to form a word the first example is compound nouns so a noun made out of two nouns in order to form one word is a compound noun so in a compound noun the first word takes the stress for example seafood how do you pronounce it with stress seafood seafood similarly toothpaste toothpaste the next class is compound adjectives so that is an adjective composed of at least two words in compound adjectives the stress is placed on the second word for example rock solid rock solid sparkling red sparkling red next we are going to look at phrasal verbs phrasal verbs are words made out of a verb and a proposition in phrasal verbs the second word gets the stress that is the preposition takes the stress for example black out break down look out let me repeat that again for you black out break down look out the next class of words that we are going to look at is reflexive pronouns so reflexive pronouns actually show the action affects the person who performs the action for example i hit myself myself here is a reflexive pronoun so in reflexive pronouns the second syllable is usually stressed for example myself themselves ourselves let me repeat that again for you myself themselves ourselves before i conclude let me give you a small tip on learning stress or understanding stress patterns in english language use dictionaries dictionaries are great tool for learning word stress in a dictionary you see that the words or the syllables where the stress goes is marked with an apostrophe which means that's the syllable you need to stress for example animation animation this mode so with that this module comes to an end i will see you with another module on a different day until stay safe happy learning
