[Music] welcome back so today's module is going to be on aspiration stress and celebification we'll have a few practice questions and you will have to pause the video work on the questions and then i will explain you the answers so let's get started the first set of question is related to celebification so this is a question how many syllables are there in the following words lexicographer magistrate civilize is boyce no linguistics sorry episode neurology let me repeat that again for you how many syllables are there in the following words the first word is lexicographer second is magistrate third is civilized fourth is east fifth is boys sixth is no seventh is linguistics eighth is sorry ninth is episode and tenth neurology so before you pause the video let me give you a small tip how do you do celebification make sure that every syllable has one vowel also make sure that every syllable has only one vowel now you may pause the video and work on these questions once you're done with this we will look at the answers okay let's look at the answers now lexicography so you're going to split it according to vowels looking at the number of vowels in a syllable right you are supposed to have only one vowel in a syllable and you are supposed to have only only one vowel in a syllable so how do you split uh lexicography leg so it's a five-syllable word the second word is magistrate ma trade so it's three-syllable word the third word is civilized see we lies so it's a three-syllable word fourth one is is it's a one-syllable word the fifth one is boys and it's a one-syllable word this is slightly tricky some of you might have divided the word into two syllables looking at the vowel letters this is where the confusion stems okay you need to look at vowel sound and not vowel letters so don't get misguided by the o and i there and then split them into two okay in boys the vowel sound o and i comes together to form o boy oy you get it it's a oi sound so it's a single syllable boys is a monosyllabic word the sixth word is no again it's a one syllable word seventh one is linguistics linguists ticks so it's three syllable word the eighth word is sorry saw re it's two syllable word the ninth word is episode a p sword so it's a three syllable word and the tenth word is neurology which is a four syllable word new raw law g did you get them right did you get all of them right did you make a few mistakes well don't worry you can always get back to the rules learn them come back practice practice new words use a dictionary you can always improve the next question is about consonant clusters so give three examples of each of the following consonant cluster where the word initial should have a consonant cluster of cc then the word final position should have a consonant cluster of cc the third is where the word initial position should have a consonant cluster of ccc and the fourth is where the word has a final consonant cluster of ccc now you pause the video work on the questions and come back now let's look at the answers yeah the words that you have come up with could be different from that of what i have chosen i'll explain you why i chose these words so with that you can evaluate your own answers so the first is words with initial consonant cluster of cc what are they i have chosen place tray and dwell in place the consonant cluster is cc it starts with per and last sound therefore the consonant cluster cc in tray it is tur and ra sound again the consonant cluster cc and dwell it's d and ver which are again consonant sounds and therefore the consonant cluster cc now words with consonant cluster at the final position pump ma so let me mark them for you please trey dwell pump help adopt the third question is to come up with the initial consonant cluster pattern ccc what is that spring straight and scream so here if you see it is sounds coming together in the second word it is sounds coming together and in the third word coming together now the words with the final consonant cluster ccc hands na [Music] again this is slightly tricky you might notice this vowel you might notice a vowel letter e here and therefore assume that it does not have a consonant cluster ccc at its end but that's not the case you're supposed to look at the concern and sounds here i'm again reiterating that this is a place where a lot of people make a mistake so let me stress this again do not be misguided by vowel letters but instead focus on the consonant sounds you need to check the sounds and not the letters so here you might see an e and might assume that it might not have a consonant cluster at the end but that's not the case in solves it's la va and sir sound at the end of the word right they're the they are the final class consonant clusters present in the word salts you don't say solve right it's sols so la va enza the third word is adopts so did you all get them right if s good if no it's fine you can always practice go back to your basics understand consonant sounds and vowel sounds and once you keep in mind this rule that you always need to evaluate and analyze words based on consonant sounds and not letters half of your confusion is over the rest half you can always go back to the rules study come back practice now the third question is related to word stress so this is a question mark the stress on the appropriate syllable first word is object object as a noun okay the second word is again object but as a verb the third word is examination fourth word is memorial fifth word is dining room pause the video work on the questions after which we will discuss the solutions now let's discuss the answers the first word is object as a noun so the rule is when a two-syllable word is used as a noun or adjective the stress is always on the first syllable of course there are exceptions but then this rule applies to at least 80 percent of of the words in that class so in this case what is the syllabification here object so where does the stress come on the first syllable so how do you pronounce it object object the stress is on or sound let's pronounce it object good of course again there are exceptions but then this rule applies to more than 80 percent of the words in that class so in this case again you celebify the word object object and the second syllable gets stress that means jaw sound gets stressed and therefore you pronounce it as object object the stresses on j sound here object object how is that different from the first word object and the second word object object did you get the difference good now the third word is examination so we have discussed that words ending with the suffix ion have stress on the penultimate syllable what's penultimate syllable it's the second last syllable or the last but one syllable so you know that the last syllable is definitely the suffix ion so what's a syllable before that n a it's no so the stress so the stress is on the nerve sound so how do you pronounce it examination examination stress on the nerve sound there repeat it after me examination good now the fourth word is memorial so again words ending with the suffix ial have stress on the syllable preceding the suffix so what's the suffix ial let me mark it for you and what's a syllable before ial it's mor so where does the stress fall the stress is on me sound there so it's memorial memorial get it repeat it after me memorial memorial good the fifth word is dining room so most compound words have primary stress on the first element we have already discussed this in the previous module let me repeat the rule again for you most compound words have primary stress on the first element so how do you pronounce it dining room the stress is on the sound here dining room dining room good now the next set of questions it's related to aspiration the question is which among the following words have aspirated sounds the first word is stop second is pot third is caught fourth is oppose fifth is tame pause the video work on the questions we will discuss the answers soon let's get to the answers so what are the words that are aspirated it's thought caught oppose and tame why let's quickly look at the rules and then i'll explain you so the first rule is that voiceless stops that is the sound and are aspirated at the beginning of a word or at the beginning of a stressed syllable so in that case if you look at the question let's go back to the question what are the words that starts with a voiceless top at the beginning of a word or at the beginning of a stressed syllable the first word no it's not a voiceless stop the second is pot yes per is a voiceless stop therefore this is an aspirated word why because the voiceless stop is at the beginning of the word get it now second again ka is a voiceless stop at the beginning of the word therefore caught is aspirated by thereby what is aspiration aspiration is that extra puff of air that you produce when you pronounce certain sounds okay now the fourth word is oppose let's celebify that up and pose right and if you look at it per sound is at the beginning of a stressed syllable because the stress is on the second syllable therefore you pronounce it as oppose so the per sound there gets aspirated so this is also aspirated tame again is aspirated because the voiceless stop tur occurs at the beginning of the word now let's go to the first word stop why is that not aspirated top is aspirated right top is aspirated but stop is not aspirated why let's again go back to the rules even if a syllable is stressed a voiceless stop is unaspirated if it follows the sound sir let me repeat that again for you even if a syllable is stressed a voiceless stop is unaspirated if it follows the sound sir so therefore because because um so this explains why top is aspirated because tur sound the voiceless stop tur occurs at the beginning of the word whereas in stop tur sound is followed by sir sound so the rule says that if a syllable even if a syllable is stressed a voiceless stop is unaspirated if it follows the sound sir the third rule is that voiceless stops are unaspirated at the beginning of an unstressed syllable they are also an aspirated in any other position like the end of the word or at the end of the syllable the fourth rule that you need to keep in mind is voiced stops are never aspirated they are always unaspirated so with that i think you have got a fair idea of how syllable rules stress rules and aspiration rules work so with this we come to the end of the session i hope you like the session i will meet you with a different topic on a different day until then stay safe happy learning
