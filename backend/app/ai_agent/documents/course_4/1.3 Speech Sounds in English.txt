[Music] hello and welcome to the class today we will talk about speech sounds in english we know that sounds that we speak are different from how they are represented with the use of symbols in writing so we are going to pay attention to sounds the way they are spoken as a note on this discussion on sounds once we understand the mechanics underlying production of these sounds the different places of articulation in our vocal tract then we understand these sounds better we compare these sounds better with the sounds of our own language you know that all of us speak a language or multiple languages other than english our goal is to improve our speaking of english we want to sound better when we speak english in order to sound better instead of practicing things blindly if we pay attention to the specifics of the things that make difference between the languages that we speak that is the sounds of the languages that we speak natively and sounds of english if we understand the differences properly if we understand specific features of sounds in english then it becomes quite easier for us to improve our english speaking it becomes easier for us to improve our pronunciation and then we sound better and the moment we start sounding better that adds to our confidence effectiveness and better communication we we know these things we have to keep this in mind that a careful note a careful attention to these things are going to add to the subconscious learning process so let's go to go straight to understanding sounds as we know all sounds can be divided into two parts two types they are consonant sounds and vowel sounds vowels are more fundamental speech sounds because they are basic for building words we will continue talking about them as well for the timing we are going to look at consonants and vowels and in particular for today consonants in little greater details so look at this we we are talking about a sound like uh we are talking about a sound like ah we are talking about a sound like e e this is e now you can you can tell that these are vowel sounds why are they vowel sounds what do we mean by vowel sounds and more specifically what are the differences between these sounds let's very briefly look at it because we want to look at consonant sounds as well and then having understood the details of consonant sounds we will come back to vowel sounds one more time now vowel sounds are produced without much obstruction in the vocal tract allow me to give you a note here about vocal tract and the process of production you see look at this picture this picture details out articulators in our vocal tract but i at this moment i want your attention to that you know we breathe air in we breathe air in through this and then all the way it goes to our lungs it has other purposes for our survival and our physiology however exhaling flow of air is responsible for production of speech sounds when we breathe in we also breathe out there is a function of lungs it retains the kind of things that it needs and remaining gets exhaled the exhaling flow of air is responsible for speech sounds not the inhaling flow when we exhale the flow of air gets modified at different places in our oral tract to give us different kinds of sounds both consonant sounds and vowel sounds i'll detail them out to you that is different places of articulation for different sounds we will come back again and do that the point that i am trying to make here is the exhaling flow of air gets modified to a great extent in multiple ways for production of consonant sounds but exhaling flow of air gets modified in a very minimal way for production of vowel sounds we can also say vowel sounds are free vowel sounds are produced from free flow of air that sounds little bit of exaggeration because no sound gets produced from free flow it it there has to be some bit of obstruction some bit of modification for production of sound so we say vowels are produced with minimal obstruction of exhaling flow of air in our oral tract that is just for you to explain we we brought this picture in to explain you just this part with little modification vowel sounds with more and different kinds of modifications we get consonant sounds so that's the fundamental distinction between vowel sounds and consonant sounds so going back to when we look at vowel sounds try saying these vowel sounds for yourself and then you will realize what we mean by free what people mean when they say free and what we mean when we say minimal obstruction so we can say ah ah the impact of this minimal obstruction is the thing that we can we can articulate we can pronounce we can say a vowel sound for longer duration of time until as much as we can hold our breath so for example you just try saying uh or ah we can continue saying like ah something of this this type e but a consonant sound this will not be possible for a consonant sound we if we try saying it saying a consonant sound for a longer duration then what we end up lending again is a vowel sound that is inbuilt vocalic sound er and not the actual consonant take an example so when you say you if you make it for a longer duration of time what allows you to make it longer is the vocalic element in the curve not the consonantal element so these are the fundamental differences between vowel sounds and consonant sounds so that's that's one distinction so what we know is we can produce a vowel sound for a longer duration of time but in normal speech we don't produce produce a vowel sound for longer duration of time in fact uh we we don't produce it for too long at all just say the words like a cup you have we have a vowel sound er here we make it very short depending upon the kind of word we have so up up we have a as a vowel sound in cup we again have a as a vowel sound then we have a as in words like father sound round again like like i said this in the beginning the way we say a particular word is very different from how they are written so at this point i have written them as english as as the way they are written in english with their spellings and the symbols the way they are used but i want your attention to the sounds so you know that uh the the first sound after so let's say we have in these three three words father sound and round you have first consonant sound and the second vowel sound that you have is an example of long vowel father sound round so ah after pha in father ah after sir in sound and ah after in the word round and likewise we have vowel sounds we see in ink sink drink so here short e at the initial position in these two words and short e at non-initial positions in the remaining of the two words are there in these four words so we have a sho an example of short e and then long e long e in words like clean seat beat feet when we when we read these words clean this word has a long vowel sound after ka and la in the word seat we have a long vowel otherwise it's only the length of the vowel that makes a difference between these two words like seat and sit only three sounds involved in the word seat sit sir so long vowel in seat short vowel in sit that's the distinction between these two words which mean two different things so you see the example of long vowels long and short vowel e in these two in these words then you have again examples of short o the distinction between short o and long look at these two in words like book cook look in all these three words you have after c the vowel that you have is an example of short o and in these words like zoo boot room the example of vowel that you have is an example of a long vowel the examples are quite clear to you i hope and i'm sure they are clearer and when you pay attention to this it becomes much clearer what i want you to do is to find more words and look for these exam these distinctions between short and long counterpart of these vowels i am i'm purposely discussing only few vowel sounds for two reasons one i want your attention to the specifics of how vowel what is the mechanism underlying production of vowel sounds second i want you to look at the distinction between short and long pair there are lot more vowels available in any language not only six but i am giving you five examples to make these distinctions for yourself so as you can see we have three pairs and the distinction between these is they are the pair is short and long short and long short and long so we have just three vowels a e and o and we have counterparts of longer duration the pronouns for longer duration of the same vowel which gives us three new sounds like [Music] and these are fundamental vowel sounds which are largely available in most of the languages including english as you see from these examples i also invite you to check these sounds in the languages that you speak primarily again i make the distinction time and again time to time i keep talking about your primary language all i mean is we all of us have another language with us other than english if we keep paying attention to that language all as well if we see do these things apply to those languages as well they have your your attention to your own language has impact on your efforts in learning of english as well then you become more aware and conscious or causes about the sounds in english and the way these sounds are produced in english one more time the distinction between these vowels should be clearer to you and we will come back to this after we have done some bit of practice in that with that we move to a discussion on some some consonant sounds and those consonants i'll i'll specifically tell you that the this discussion may not be directly applicable to english consonants like i have i have mentioned that the six vowel sounds that we have discussed are part of english invent inventory of sounds in english as well however the vowels the consonant sounds that we are going to discuss may not be may all of them may not be part of english but allow me to describe this thing to you and then i take you to english sounds where you can see you can see the distinction with a closer look so what what is it that i am asking you to do is just to look at these 25 sounds there are 25 sounds in this chart and i want you to look at this many of them are available in english many of them are available in languages that you speak and many of them are definitely available in english when we indians speak english therefore i want your attention to this chart and how do let's let's go into the details so how this chart helps us understand consonant sound so here here we go you see we have so so what are these sounds first of all let me read them to you and here is the last one i am keeping this separate and i also want you to look at this and so we have and then we have this nasal sound na so then you can look at this then we have to [Music] first point to note out of this chart of 25 we have 20 of them as oral sounds and these five of them are called nasal sounds what's the meaning what's the distinction between oral and nasal i am going to show you that distinction but before we go there let's look at one more point and then we go and verify that that point is ka is known as a wheeler sound because it comes from veelum cha is known as a palatal sound because it comes from palette region in our vocal tract ta is a retroflex sound ta is a dental sound and pa is a labial sound or bilabial sound because it comes from lips so let's go back backward you can see both lips coming together to produce this sound therefore a bilabial sound the tip of the tongue goes in the middle of upper teeth and lower teeth and thus we get the retroflex meaning meaning of that is the tongue particularly the tip of the tongue curls backward folds backward and in that fashion it hits the areas muscular areas of upper teeth not the teeth the muscular area of our teeth where we have our upper teeth in fixed that area is also known as alveolar so the tongue curled tongue unfolds backward in alveolar region the sounds that we get are called retroflex sounds and that sound one of one such example is term sure palatal sound because the the body of the tongue blade of the tongue is in contact with pallet area chair not the tip of the tongue but the body of the tongue and the tip of the tongue has no role in it because velum is quite low in our vocal tract so the lower part of the tongue is in contact with velam area and thus we get velar sounds so i'll show you that but so we we talked about but all these in this series all of them in this series are palatal sound cha cha they're all palatal sounds they are all bilabial sounds we come back to this part one more time having looked at this one more time we saw this picture when we were talking about vowel sounds now let's look at this picture one more time when we are looking at consonant sounds remember the exhaling flow of air we have we we inhale this way and then we have exhaling flow of air from here when it moves upward look at this this is the velum area so the body of the tongue here the the exhaling flow of air gets modified in particular ways and we will go back to those ways as well and it gets blocked here and then the sound that we get is known as ka if you speak this sound and pay attention to the articulators the place from where this sound comes and the sound itself you will realize that we are getting we you will understand this discussion i am putting this on record and i am speaking this to you through this video there is nothing embarrassing about doing this practice for understanding the places of articulation of these sounds for making our pronunciation our speaking better and you can give half an hour of time to yourself to check place of articulation of every sound that you are going to see at least once and then you will get the point that we are trying to make through these articulators and through this detailed discussion on discussing sound production mechanism the mechanics mechanism underlying sound production system so that's that's the vlam area then we were talking about palatal so the next at the next point where the body of the tongue produces a second set of sounds chair is here then you have these teeth so look at this so what happens is the tip of the tongue goes here is our here is our teeth area and this is the muscular region so the tip of the tongue folds backward and then hits this area in the alveolar waste region this alveolar reason and then the sound that we get are called retroflex sounds when the tip of the tongue look at this i don't know yeah tongue tip tip of the tongue comes in between this teeth this then we get a dental sound and when these lips come together we get labial sounds so so i am only talking about five of them velum palette this alveolar region tongue teeth and lips these are fixed places velum palette alveolar resin teeth reason teeth and lips these are fixed places in our vocal tract the only one organ that mo can move backward and forward to to get in touch with these areas is tongue it's tongue so we through this picture we understand the uh places and movement by this time you must have figured out this is just a picture of a posterior picture of our vocal tract the the point that i made right in the beginning about the distinction between nasal sounds and oral sounds is the following so and and that all distinction also you can hear when you speak the sound so when we say pa and ma ma say these two sounds for yourself and then see what kind of distinction do you observe between them say dental and na na what's the distinction between these two i'm particularly asking you to look at these two what is the distinction and how does this distinction become critical here is the here is how the distinction becomes please look at this so all the places of articulations that we talk about like willam palette teeth alveolar region and lips they are in the oral cavity and then we have a big area as look at this nasal cavity which is this area and there is one more organ here look at this this is uvula so it is if if we open our mouth also little wider we see from the from the roof of the the this area we see some something hanging uh in when we open our mouth wide open that organ is called uvula that's a very critical organ for sound production and here is how it works when this gets raised look at this this is the this is the passage through which x-fil exhaling flow of air moves if it gets raised then it blocks this cavity it blocks this cavity and no air moves through no air moves through nasal cavity the movement the air flows only through oral cavity and thus the sounds that we get from different places of articulations are called oral sounds when the uvula is not raised it is gets lowered down then the part of the flow of this exhaling air can move through this nasal cavity as well and then the sounds that we get are called nasal sounds so ma when we say ma you will is lowered air little bit of air moves through the nasal cavity little bit little part from the exhaling flow it moves through the oral cavity as well as the nasal cavity and thus we get some nasal sounds that's the distinction between oral and nasal sound so pa is an oral labial sound bilabial sound and ma is bilabial nasal sound and that's how we make the distinction so now we understand the two-way distinction between oral consonants and nasal consonants and we also understand the distinction about different places of articulations what this this part becomes clearer for understanding places of articulations so here is what i want you to do i want you to look at this do do a very clear practice of these sounds with you and check their places of articulations as i mentioned most of these sounds are part of the languages that we speak i come back here here is another this another range of features that i will come back to but right now i want you look at the features on this vertical axis that is they are places of articulation i come back to these things later for the time being what i want you to look at is these sounds of english these are 24 specific english sounds they are pa ba ma and i want you to pay attention to this axis how do we pay attention to this axis look at this these are the three bilabial sounds in english are labiodental sounds you can understand bilabial sounds are produced by both lips bringing together labiodental sounds are produced by lip lower lip and upper teeth together labiodental and the are two dental sounds in english are alveolar sounds in english all of them are alveolar sounds in english these two sha and ja are post alveolar sounds in english yeah there's a palatal sound ka na are velar sounds and these are ha and there is one more girl two glottal sounds in english now see there are a lot of sounds here which are not part of our vocal tract our our sound system so we need to learn these sounds separately to sound better while speaking english at the same time we need to do little bit of modification in the way we have been speaking if we bring in sounds from our languages in speaking english we will sound the way we usually sound but we if we want to improve that we need to understand this distinction look at this chart of english sounds and try to try to practice these sounds the way they should be produced understanding their places of articulations so with this with this discussion on places of articulations and the distinction of sounds we can very well get an idea of how consonant sounds are produced in english and this will give you a clearer idea about sound system little bit about vowel sounds and little bit about consonant sounds we stop here we i expect you to have done a little bit of practice we'll see you again with something else next time thank you so much
