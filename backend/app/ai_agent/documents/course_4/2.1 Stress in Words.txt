[Music] welcome to the class we are going to talk about stress patterns in words in english i'll explain and describe what we mean by stress right at the onset one more time i would like you to understand that we are looking at certain underlying patterns underlying means certain patterns which we may not notice outrightly when we either hear others speak english or we may not be paying attention to when we speak english on our own so i am talking about two specific aspects one is listening the other is speaking there are certain things that we may not pay attention to stress is one such thing sometimes when we pay attention to that we don't quite get it we keep wondering why certain words when others speak sound different and if a word sounds different in the sense that when i speak a word that is as as a listener and when someone else speaks the same word if there is a difference between the two sometimes that causes issues in understanding so a mismatch between listening and speaking can result into difficulty in understanding these things stabilize normalize but we need to understand and when we pay attention to certain things we get these things set right and that is the that is the sub impact on our subconscious for the purpose of learning so again what i am trying to tell you is the underlying pattern of stress that i want to discuss with you today is for the purpose of paying attention to them so that when we hear others we don't wonder about these things and if we want to pay if we want to practice this further then we can fix our own words the way we speak and thus such fiction will result into you sounding better and thus we that's that's this discussion so the point is before we fix something in the process of learning we need to know what is it that i need to fix and therefore i am talking about certain underlying stuff and once we get these things once we once we see and this is the reason why i'm calling it underlying pattern underlying for a very simple reason that they are not quite obvious and and once we see that it it becomes quite apparent to us and we become careful about these things so what is stress so we know about words we we know a word is a group of sounds we also know that group of sounds in a word is not random it has a sequence and there are certain sequences which are quite frequent like alternations of consonant and vowel is quite frequent a gemination of two consonants is still okay but not so frequent a cluster of three consonants is rare but still okay but a cluster of four consonants at the initial position of a word is not so not not at all possible heavy clusters of different consonants at different positions in a word is also quite prohibited we get we rarely get a word like this so we know we know about certain restrictions in which the way we get words so the the bottom line is a word is not a random collection of sounds at the same time look at the other flip side of the word we have only 44 sounds in english 24 consonant sounds and 20 vowel sounds but it is possible to get infinite number of words out of these 44 sounds doesn't it sound miraculous we we get to understand this miracle in a scientific way once we understand sounds properly and it has impact on developing confidence for us so thus we know about words we also know that words can have just one syllable or words can have multiple syllables as you as you can see a syllable is a unit of word so and this is not quite obvious in a monosyllabic word because a monosyllabic word is a word by itself and that's also a syllable so there is not much of a discussion about syllable in a monosyllabic word but when we we see the significance of celebification or syllables in a word when we start looking at at least word words with at least two syllables so what happens is we know that each syllable must have a vocalic sound a vowel sound in its nucleus once again i would like to add a footnote here that when if you read a lot about syllables you will realize that sometimes a non-vocalic sound can also be the nucleus of a syllable but i don't want to take you into those details what i want you to know is uh most often and so often that we can say almost always the nucleus the focal point in a syllable is a com is a vowel sound and therefore vowels are fundamental to words so no syllable is possible without a vowel sound therefore no word is possible without a vowel sound however a word is possible only with vowel sounds a word can a word can be as small as just one sound so so these are the redundant things about words that we already know and once we know the process of formation of words particularly underlying process in that that we observe in formation of words these things uh these things sound like general knowledge to us about words so i i want your attention now to syllables and celebrification keep in mind syllable and solidification in a natural way is intuitive to speakers of the language uh we we don't have we we it it's it's called uh it's it's a foundational stuff in the sense that native speakers have natural intuition towards celebification in their of words in their language so what what intuition what intuitive means is and in innately intuitive what we mean by that is it's tough to learn for non-native speakers of that language nonetheless it's not impossible to observe and therefore bring in practice and therefore getting matured through the observing patterns underlying words so that's that that is what we know about celebification so words can have one syllable two syllables three syllables four syllables one more time i would say one syllable words are huge in numbers we we have two three four syllables quite frequently we see inwards words larger than five syllables or six syllables are very rare and the reason is very simple that it's difficult to produce and pronounce such words and therefore a heavy word a multi-syllabic heavy word is not preferred though technically it's possible to make a multi-syllable word so the focal point of a word is a vowel sound because that point is also true for syllables so once we understand syllables so look at the examples as monosyllabic words like sun life break tongue we have these are some of the examples of mana salami and there are a lot of them like cat rat and so on when we see words with two syllables like tiger police between marriage these are random words and i'll i'll tell you why i picked random words and why i why i recommend you to pick certain random words okay i come to that but let me make my point here that these words when we look at words with two syllables and here is the point of uh today's discussion it's a generic role in english language is one of the two or one of the many that is if we have three syllables then still one if we have four syllables still one is going to be more prominent than other syllables so i i start with dye syllabic word that is words with two syllables so out of the two one cell one of the syllables is going to be more prominent this prominence the way we make one syllable more prominent than the other is known as stress so so what what we need to get is stress means prominence stress means bringing something forthright so one of the syllables is going to be more prominent than others this is the generic role this is a role which has probably no exception and therefore we this is how we understand stress so then then what is so this much is not difficult what is difficult is which one of the two is stressed this is intuitive to native speakers but we can always observe and here at at this slide at this screen i haven't tried to bring the prominence in but we we're what we are going to do is when we make uh for the for the purpose of writing uh we have tried to put stressed syllable in caps so i'll show you that so look at the words like energy capital suffering these are all three syllable three syllabic words four syllable words are invisible education aquarium infinity these are four syllable words so uh the rule is the same the moment the because we don't have the question of prominence in monosyllabic word because prominence by definition comes when we have more than one so the moment we have two three four and more syllables one becomes more prominent and this phenomenon is known as stress in english now which one is more prominent than the others is intuitive to native speakers we see we understand this part by observing native speakers speak and while observing if we try to bring that into practice if we try to imbibe that we can make our speech also impressive by placing stress at right places so though this is intuitive there are certain things that we can still talk about it what what i am going to discuss here hereafter is certain patterns but these are observable patterns we cannot take them as rules they they do apply to a large extent but as you know rules are only such things are called rules which cannot be broken which should not generate exceptions but so this is observation this apply to great extent so let's look at so so first i want to bring you back to which one of the so let's look at four words of two syllables tiger which one sounds more prominent to you tiger between between police police you make a decision about this at this point i am not speaking about it i i think you would have figured it out by now and then i want you to okay before i look at uh patterns and before i describe the patterns to you i am going to put one exercise for you here and exercise is see for understanding syllables the for understanding stress it is important to understand celebification so take random 20 words and celebrate and and see the celebification of it if you are taking 20 words it's highly likely that you will get celebrification of 10 right and then there are tools available these days online we can help you with those those tools there are dictionaries there are websites which give you syllable boundaries that is which breaks the word in two different syllables for you so what you can do first you take 20 random words do this exercise yourself first see how many syllables how many when you do the celebification how many breaks are there how many syllables have those words have then check your celebification online or through a dictionary this will help you set celebification right and out of 20 20 words that you have you may get maybe uh five one syllable words five two syllable words five three syllable words and five four syllable words so basically uh what i am trying to tell you is try to get a set of 100 words do this exercise for 100 words and see if you can come up with 20 monosyllabic words 20 dicelebric word 20 uh three syllable words 20 four syllable words and twenty five syllable words this is the first stage of the exercise and once you have once you have this this this may be a little tedious this may take take time you don't have to do this in one day or one hour but if you continuously work on this i am quite confident you will get a sense of celebification in english language the at the second stage of that because we know that one of the syllables is stressed beginning from words with two syllables one of the syllables is more prominent so either you speak you observe others or again take help from online tools and you will get the stress syllable and then try to say that word with intended syllable at the right place start with those first those hundred words and then this exercise will automatically take you to a point where you get any word and you will you will find little uneasiness and restlessness to find right solidification and right stress at the right place and once you get this thing you will get used to this uh celebrification and and uh placing a stress at the right place which will have natural result in your speaking and that this this improves your speaking so now let's look at some of those patterns how we work with celebification in look at this i i am speaking these words and i leave you to find stress at the right place i am not native speaker of english i have learned english quite late some of them may not have a stress at the right place but that also you can check energy capital heritage suffering invisible aquarium education infinity check how it works here are certain patterns you see there is a there is a there is a generic so so as i mentioned uh it's unpredictable unpredictable for non-native speakers and intuitive for native speakers so we can only observe patterns so one pattern is when we look at when we see a noun and this is why we need to know class of words so when we have either a noun or an adjective which is derived basically which is derived noun or derived adjective which is what we say uh a word when a when a word or when a noun or adjective stems from a one-syllable word for example break and friend like you know we have example breakable or friendly so the the the word in that is break and friend though and the derived word is breakable friendly then what happens is the stress is usually on the main syllable that is original word so it's a monosyllabic word and we are adding certain suffix to that and thus it is becoming two-syllable word anyway so whether it is an adjective or a noun we have a stress on the primary cell primary syllable the first syllable which is also i put it as original word so the moment you see a word like this it's easy for you to predict stress that it's on the original word like breakable friendly friendly so i have capitalized the word break and friend to make sure that this is this this is the syllable which is stressed so this is this is one such pattern and that gives an idea that most of the derived words from a noun or an from a word uh noun or an adjective we can get we the derived words will have main syllable the original word stressed thus we get breakable friendly since we are talking about nouns and adjectives in a dyslexic noun or adjectives stress is on the first syllable so any now we now we are not talking about derived nouns so take any noun most of the time most of the time the stress in a noun is going to be on the first syllable like present present tiger breakfast breakfast some examples of adjectives like handsome easy happy so you see a first syllable in all these dye syllabic words words with two syllables are being stressed so the stress is found on the first syllable you we are going to get a stress in two syllable words or three syllable words four syllable words key is to find out where where lies the stress and we are trying to look at some patterns so in a so so we talked about nouns and adjectives now we are going to look at verbs so what happens in a dicelebric words verbs that is a verb with two syllables the stress is usually on the last thing so look at the look at a word like increase increase begin these are so the two syllable in the word increase is in crease i have i have not put this in phonetic transcription purposely because this is how we write these words and i am only trying to separate two syllables here so crease is the syllable which is being stressed begin in second syllable is the one that is getting stress on it there could be reasons for that uh but we don't want to go into further reasons all all we are saying is dice syllabic words words verbs with two syllables will have stress on second syllable so and and and remember a proper stress and understanding of a stress while of course while speaking and understanding of celebification is also going to help us understand when a word is a noun being used as noun and when a word is being used as adjective i'm sorry as a word there are there are so many things that we can learn through this why same word can be used as nouns and same word can also be used as an as a verb the reason is for native speakers the stress patterns makes them different and this is called applying principle of economy through a principle of economy in the structure of language and application of principle of economy is one of the specific features of human mind and you you we can understand these details at a later point but i am just bringing in this idea of principle of economy because learning of language and developing underlying patterns of language is part of subconscious subconscious development in human mind so same word is being used as noun or a verb that is because they they are going to have different distress patterns the stress patterns one more time is if we have a two syllable nouns stress on the first syllable initial syllable if we have two syllables two a verb with two syllables usually stress on the second syllable so look at look at some example how we differentiate the nouns and there are there are some words and we are giving you just few examples like decrees and object so how are we going to say decrease as noun decrease decrease as worth decrease decrease object and object and object and object so the stress on the initial syllable as well to object to object stress on second syllable object to object this this this helps us differentiate nouns from verbs when they are when the same word is used for nouns and verbs both yet another pattern is when you have compound nouns that is two nouns merged together to form a new word the stress is on the first part that is first syllable like bookshop bookshop so the stress is on book not on shop notebook notebook stress is on note this is easy pattern to to see i i put my footnote one more time that there are so many patterns we we don't have a list of all of them we are only trying to put a few to get a sense of it when we have words which end with this suffix like shun like in station or tension or shen like education permission and physician the stress is usually on penultimate syllable penultimate means second last syllable not on the last one not on sun or sheen but the syllable before that so when you see a word like this we have used this word before education education the predictable stress in this world is not on last one t i o n that syllable but k e k sun so the the k syllable will have a stress on it because that's the penultimate to this last one it's the second last one permission permission so the second syllable is going to be stressing that physician or magician or these types of words they are quite productive patterns of word formation in english so uh it's easy to determine the presence of a stress in the penultimate syllable in these words same thing applies when we have a derived word from x suffix like realistic strategic see each these words these types of words have suffix at the end strategic strategic strategic realistic it this this is also quite productive pattern in english so again the stress is on the penultimate syllable that is the second last second last syllable realistic few more uh patterns for us to think about words it's tough to talk about these patterns but nonetheless uh they seem to be working therefore we are talking about them when we have when we have words ending with long e or long oo like a word like guarantee or shampoo then we have a stress on the last syllable so the stress gets so so these these sounds are sellable by themselves and they carry uh stress on them so we have words like guarantee this has three syllable the last syllable itself gets the stress shampoo the last syllable oh gets the stress in this word i have already talked about this that when we get a word where we don't have these patterns being applicable then as speakers of indian english speakers of english in india we don't stress anyone beca any any syllable because putting syllables putting a stress at the wrong syllable that is purposely putting a stress on a syllable where it should not appear doesn't sound good sometimes that might sound a little awkward too so this is why i say if we are not sure about it we don't need to waste us we need to be naturally speaking the way we speak english in india however looking at applying some of these patterns and observing patterns uh making a list of the words of of some words uh few words with oneself with two syllables three syllables four syllables and then trying to find syllable at the right uh right syllable the the the syllable which carries the stress and paying attention to this will help us speak properly that and hereby properly i mean with a stress at the right syllable and we are going to sound sound better so the purpose of this discussion was to observe certain patterns of celebification and stress and finding out which one of the two or three or four syllables is carrying stress becoming more prominent this discussion has implications for improving our speaking
