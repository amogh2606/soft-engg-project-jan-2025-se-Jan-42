[Music] so when it comes to telephony conversation you either make a call or you take a call when do you make a call you make a call by dialing the person's number and then the phone rings when the phone rings the person picks it up and that is what is known as taking the call so the situation that invites you to make a call could be formal when do you make formal calls when you have to make calls to your boss to your office colleagues so all of these can be categorized under the formal calls whereas when you talk to your family members when you talk to your friends all of them can be seen as informal calls so let me give you a small example i'm going to tell you how you should start a phone conversation in both formal and informal context so you start by greeting and then you introduce yourself so an example of formal me context working for air voice services and this is how she is starting the phone conversation she starts by greeting saying hi hello this is megha from airboy services or she could also say my name is megha i'm calling from the air voice services oh when it comes to informal calls let's suppose you're making a call to your friend you didn't start the way you started for a formal call right you wouldn't say my name is this and i'm calling for xyz purpose you would start with hi how is it going or you would say hi how are you or hi what's up how do you respond uh to to those questions you may say good thanks what about you or you could say good thanks how about you or you could also say not much the usual how about you now here is another situation and that situation is when you have to ask for someone so again i'm going to divide it um on the basis of formal and informal context so let's suppose in a formal context you want to call your friend padmini you make the call so making the call to her office number and somebody else her colleague has picked up the call so how do you phrase that how do you ask for padmini you may say may i speak to padmani or could i speak with padmini or i would like to speak to padmani you may also add please at the end of the question or the sentence so in that case you may say may i speak to padmini please or could i speak with padmini please or i would like to speak to padmini please now if this is an informal context let's suppose padme is at home but she has not picked up the call instead her sister who's a good friend of yours as well picks up the call so how would how do you ask for padmini hi is padmini around or you would ask or you could ask is padmini there or can i talk to padmini so there you don't have to be formal you don't have to add please at the end of these questions okay now getting to the purpose of the call so once you greet you ask for someone what next then you tell the person why you call him or her for so again in a formal context you could say i'm calling to ask about i'm giving you an example let's suppose you want to know more about some software consulting services so you could say hello i am calling to ask about your software consulting services then you could continue the conversation saying could you tell me and so on for example could you tell me how much it costs whereas in informal situation let's suppose you're calling your friend you could just say hey i just wanted to ask if you're free to meet sometime this weekend hey i just wanted to know if you are available for a movie this weekend so that's how you get to the purpose of the call now checking on their availability again let's suppose we're going to divide it according to formal and informal context in a formal context you are making a call to your friend uh and she's in the office you're making a call to her office number and she's not around somebody else picks up the call and then um they say that this person is not around so how do you ask for that person's availability you could you could ask when would be a good time to call her or uh if you are if you're talking to the person directly if your friend says that look i have a board meeting now uh can can we talk later then you could say when we when would be a good time to call or if someone else has picked up the call for her you could ask when will he or she be back or please let me know your best convenient time or please let me know her best convenient time for a call and in an informal context like i've already said if padmini sister has picked up the call and she's saying that you know padmani is not around the next question that you can ask you know checking on the availability is do you know when she'll be back now leaving a message how do you leave a message so padmani sister says look she's not around she'll be back maybe in a couple of hours so you feel okay in that case let me leave a message for her so what are the things that you can say in that context let's check it out using a phone conversation so listen to this one con conversation this will help you understand the different phrases and the questions that you can use in this context hello could i speak to padmini please i'm sorry she's not around oh that's all right i would like to leave her a message could you please take a message for her yes of course or you may tell padme that meera had called you could also ask her to call me back sure i will tell her she can reach me at 7708-645-321 oh wait a second please let me grab a pen and a paper to make a note of that number could you please repeat your number yeah sure my number is seven seven zero eight six four five three two one okay fine noted okay thank you bye now taking a call when do you take a call when your phone rings you take a call you could also say you're picking up the call so again we look at both informal and formal context first the formal context let me give you a context okay so make was working for air voice services and a lot of customers call her to inquire about various plans and various customer services so let's see how megha introduces herself after picking up the call so you could say so megha could say good afternoon air voice services make her speaking or she could say hello good afternoon air voice services how may i help you or she could also say thank you for calling air voice services this is megha what can i do for you today or it's also possible that she could say thank you for calling airboy services this is megha how may i help you or what can i do for you now we'll listen to a phone conversation and understand this process better we will know how to use certain phrases and sentences or the different kinds of phrases and sentences that you can use when you take a call good afternoon thank you for calling avoid services how may i help you this is kavitha calling from adipakum i had recharged my phone with an international roaming plan which i see is still not activated okay please hold on ma'am i'll put you through the technical team okay hello mam it was a technical glitch from our side sorry for the inconvenience caused by the delay the team has worked on it the plan will be activated in 15 minutes anything else that i can help you with no nothing else thank you so much thank you have a nice day now asking who is calling suppose you're not familiar with the voice okay in that case you could ask may i know who's calling or may i ask who is calling or could i ask who is calling or who's calling please or who am i speaking to please and then you can also follow up with the question where you calling from please however if the voice sounds familiar to you then you could say hello is that padmini so i hope i made this part clear these are all the questions that you can use in order to ask or know who is calling now asking to wait again we'll listen to another phone conversation this will help you familiarize with certain questions and certain sentences and phrases that you can use to ask the other person to hold or to wait hello can i speak to meera please could you hold on i will check if she's around yeah sure i sorry to keep you waiting mira has gone to the nearby temple with her grandmother she is not around do you want me to

leave a message i'm tied up at the moment can i call you back in an ass time if it is not urgent can i bus you later in the evening you just have two minutes be quick in what you have to say or i won't be able to have a long chat as i'm driving now this conversation will take longer can i call you later all these based on the context these are all the sentences you can use based on different context based on the context that you're in now on receiving a second call let's suppose you're already on a call with someone and you're receiving a second call what are the phrases that will come or sentences phrases and sentences that you can use or that will come handy to you when you receive a second call you could say i am receiving a second call could you hold for a second or could you hold for a minute you could also say i'm speaking to someone on the other side if it's not urgent can i call you in some time you could say i'm getting a call from my professor i will have to answer i will call you back soon or again depending on the context i'm getting a call from my family or i'm getting a call from my dad i'm getting a call from off from my office i'll have to answer this i'll call you back soon or you could also say please hold on for a second my boss is pinging me please hold on for a second my boss is pinging me what is pinging your ping is a synonym for call so instead of saying my boss is calling me you could also use my boss is pinging me so now coming to conference calls what are conference calls what is a conference call a conference call is a call that you make to multiple people at the same time so you put people on a conference call so i'm giving you a situation here here rama is talking to gita and that is when sita is calling ram and they all want to discuss the office work so ram says and he says this to gita look sita is calling me or he could also say look sita is pinging me can i get sita with us so geeta says of course we would like to discuss this with sita as well so he says wait a second let me rope in sita into this call this is important rope in let me rope in and then you tell sita that is ram tells sita that i am having gita with me on the other side i am patching you in meaning i am adding you to this call with gita patching you patching you in and once he does that to confirm whether he is audible to both of them he says gita and sita am i audible to both of you so he's asking both of them am i audible and once a conversation begins and they discuss about the project then ram says gita please stay on the line sita could you disconnect i will call you later so they discuss whatever is required with sita so now ram feels that sita could disconnect and he needs to talk more with gita and therefore he ends up saying gita please stay on the line sita you could disconnect i will call you later now let's talk about phone problems we all encounter or we all have difficulties you know hearing the other person time to time right when we make a phone conversation when we make phone calls with uh friends families and you know colleagues in both formal and informal context what are the sentences that can be used in such situations so i'm giving you one situation and this is where gita cannot hear the other person and she is not sure if the other person is on the line so in that case she may ask hello are you there or hello can you hear me or hello am i audible uh hello is my voice clear enough hello can you hear me loud and clear hello is my voice too low so these are all the questions that you that you can ask if you're not sure whether the other person is on the line or not the second situation is where lenna is on a phone conversation with anjali and anjali realizes that she is running out of charge so her phone is going to die soon in in that case what are the sentences that can be used she may say please be quick my battery is about to die she could say i might lose you soon lose you soon okay as i'm on one person battery she could also say my battery is about to drain please text me or can i call you after charging my phone or let me grab a charger and call you back now let's look at the third situation that is when gita is not able to hear the other person properly we must all have encountered this situation um multiple times when we make phone calls uh you either hear your own voice or you you you hear the other person's voices echoing or you know surfacing back or you hear them in bits and pieces so what are the sentences that we can use when you cannot hear the other person properly so one you can say hello i can hear you on and off then the second sentence is hello your voice is breaking you could also say your voice is jarring when do you say your voice is jarring you know when many a time we we end up um you know hearing some kind of vibrating noise right and that is what is known as jarring so you could say your voice is jarring the next one is hello i can hear you but in bits and pieces the fifth one is hello your voice is echoing you know that is when the voice surfaces back or sometimes you could hear or you might hear your own voice in in that case you could say look my voice is echoing let me cut the call and call you back again or you could also say hello i think you got cut off okay now the other phone problems are when you just hear a beep sound that is when you say i couldn't get through that number or you know when you hear multiple beep sounds maybe it could also mean that the other person is busy or engaged in that case you could say looks like the line is busy i'll call her later or you could say the line is engaged she is she's talking to somebody else i'll call her later or if there's no sound at all um you could either say the looks like the phone is dead or you could say she is unobtainable or the line is unobtainable now there is another instance and which is the wrong number the other situation is the wrong number so rather than saying wrong number which we generally tend to say you could say sorry i think you have got the wrong number or you could say there is no one or none of that name here now how do you end a call if it is a formal situation then you could say okay no problem i'll try again later this is when your calls of your call for someone but that person is not around and her your friend's colleague is telling you that she's not around so you could say no problem i'll try again later or uh you know if you're on the receiving end and if your friend's friend has asked you to pass on a message you could say okay great i will pass on the message in an informal uh phone conversation you could say it was a great conversation let us connect regularly or take care let us be in good touch or take care goodbye now if there's some connectivity issue um or you know um you get another call you want to hang up then then what are the sentences that you can use in that context you could say i might lose you soon there's some connectivity issue here i might lose you soon there is some connectivity issue here then you could say i need to hang up now let us continue the conversation tomorrow you could also say it's been an hour we are talking i need to get back to work or listen my class is about to start i'll talk to you later this is when you have to cut the call abruptly and again based on the different context so i hope uh you have picked up a few phrases and sentences that you know will come handy to you in phone conversations with that we come to the end of this module i will meet you with a different module on a different day until then stay safe take care bye
