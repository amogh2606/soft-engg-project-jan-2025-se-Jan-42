[Music] welcome to the class today we will look at plurals in English that is plural words plurality is one specific features of nouns in English or for that matter in any language but we are going to look at English nouns for our for the purpose of learning English so we know that there are lots of other categories of words in any language like nouns adjectives adverbs verbs prepositions and so on we're going to look at those descriptions in in other classes but today we will talk specifically about nouns and one specific feature of this noun which is called plurality so given this what we see is nouns can be of two types that is singular nouns and plural nouns so this is important singular nouns and plural we also need to know what is it now like I said like I mentioned we will look at these things in details in some other class but for for the purpose of this class and for the purpose of definition if we simply say noun is a word which denotes name of anything in short nouns are naming words names of anything is now that will cover all other definitions like is a person place thing that is when some somebody says noun is a word which is name of a person place or thing we can reduce that also to the following that nouns are naming words so that's that's about nouns so when we talk about nouns they're they can be of two types one is singular and the other is to be absolutely clear about that singular is one anything that is denoting one element that's called similar that's the singularity feature of now plural is more than one more than one it's plural in English and many in many many other languages anything that is more than one is considered plural so with this information about nouns and the meaning of singular and plural we need to see what is it how is it that we see plurals or plurality indicated on English words how do we learn it so when we start observing patterns we see the following things we see look at some of these nouns very common nouns very commonly used nouns like talk friend judge bench baby book come what we see in these nouns when we make them plurals we see we we see see these are the plural words you can read these words for yourself plurals are dogs dogs friends judges bench it's babies books caps this is how these words some these are singular forms these are plural forms singular forms are dog friend judge bench baby book cap read it for yourself dog friend judge bench baby book and cup plurals are dogs friends judge's benches babies box caps if we are asked to indicate what marks plurality on these words we can indicate like this we can indicate that in a plural word we add this we add s we add S or ES or IES so we see s as you see in many examples dog friend judge and book and cap and in some examples we see we are adding es like bench and baby IES in babies there are more for example a word like knife there are more words where we see different types of plural markers but we will stick to our discussion on some simple words among the different types of descriptions what we want to specifically mention and leave them aside are words like teeth which is the plural of two words like oxen which is the plural of ox and children which is the plural of child we want to leave these things aside not because we don't want to discuss them but because these are some remanence --is of Old English you know languages change time to time languages develop some patterns and people acquire those patterns and this this refers to the dynamic nature of language due to some process in the language certain things don't change and they remain in the older format so these are the examples of certain older formats and we carry them forward in English maybe at some time they will also change maybe we will see some people say instead of children childs we don't know but as of now the plural of child is children so we will leave them aside I want you to focus on this pattern where we are told where when we see the pattern we see that we add either S or ES or IES or maybe a few more so what's the rule of plural information in English how do we learn it there are a lot of words lot of nouns in English we need to know about that because we are going to be using plurality all the time to understand this there is a very simple rule that rule first makes us pay attention to something else which is instead of looking at how these words are written in singular and plural we need to look at how these words are spoken in singular and plural please hear it out one more time instead of looking at how these words are written in their singular forms and plural forms we need to look at how these words are spoken in their singular forms and plural forms what will be the difference if we change this point this pattern that is if we look at how words are spoken what will be the difference the difference is we are going to be paying attention to the sounds and in particular the last sounds of these words what is the last sound in these words if you if you look at singular go back and look at singular words what was the singular sound singular what was the last sound in these words in their singular form in a word like dog the last sound is girl in a dog in a word like friend the last sound is Doug in a word like judge the last sound is Jim in a word like bench the last sound is Chuck in a bird like baby last sound is e it's a bobble sound in a word like book the last sound is cup and in a word like cap the last sound is pot in a word like kept the last sound is done so take any word and look at the last sound so what we what we see in that it's what we add as the plural marker is also important to look at so how does the plural marker sound in these words now leave the plural markers how do we how does it sound when we say dogs it sounds as some dogs friends judges so look at it apparently it looks like we are adding s we are adding s we are adding s but when you are looking at this we are adding sir we are adding sir but when we come here we need to add sir but because this the preceding sound is also a consonant and thus such a sequence will make it very difficult to speak we add a short vowel here which makes it sound like is jerseys this is why you see it here it's bench benches because sir and chair these are alveolar or sounds from palatal region depending on who speaks these things we are just inserting another vowel otherwise it is in a word like babies remember the last sound of baby the singular form was e anyway so what we are doing here is we are adding only sir it becomes babies and in a word like books we are adding sir and any word like caps we are adding again sir so what we when we look at this we see there are two clearly distinct patterns in some words we are adding sir in some words we are adding son this pattern emerges when you look at how these words are spoken so in the process of learning in we can also say instead of saying in some place add s in some place and ears in some place add IES we can simply say speak the word and then add either sir or to it because there are only two plural marking sounds in English you only need to know where we need to add sir and where me too this is the most critical part of learning plurality in English once we figure this out we are done with plurality it's a very simple rule and helps us be capture most of the words in plurality in understanding plurality in English and in return it also helps us improve our pronunciation it also helps us improve how we speak so we don't want to say it sound like dogs weed we don't want to be saying like we don't don't want to say word dogs as dogs friends we want to say the way it is spoken like dogs take any word you and and at this point I also want to remind you to do this exercise for yourself take any 1520 words for yourself take your note again same pattern of exercise take a notebook close your eyes think about some nouns or if you are not finding them just look around yourself whatever you see chairs computers TV plates clocks anything that you see just write down the name because you know nouns are naming words you see door you see window anything that you see just try to don't write down the plural form observe the plural markers what what they are and to learn that here is the rule that we are going to talk about rules are very simple now before we look at the rules look at these two sounds sir Ensor if you apply your learning of places of articulations of these sounds you will see that sir Ensor both are fricative sounds what are negative sounds the the only difference is this is not voiced and this is voiced remember when we speak a voice sound we see some very vibration on this one in our vocal cords so when you say sir put it here try it for yourself and see when you say sir you won't feel any additional vibration here but when you say sir you will you will feel some vibration coming from here so this it's this vibration from the vocal cord while saying the sound sir which is technically known as voicing makes the difference between sir Enza so in in one way we can say it's the same sound with the difference of voicing in one situation it is not voiced in one situation it is voiced but let's let's take them as two different sounds sir Ensor now we only need to know where we use and where we use the rule is pretty simple rule is very simple in in English if the word ends with three sounds ba ba ba any noun in English which ends with these results that is if the last sound of a word is either per the Orca use so sound that's it you need to do everywhere else the plural marker is look how simple it is if a word does not end with per taka safely you can add plural markers so look at a word like o'clock this one ends with car very simple pluralist clocks take any other word window what's the last sound of this word oh it's a vowel sound and more importantly it's not one of these that is Parker very safely you can say the plural marking sound at the end of this word is keep in mind we are not talking about how we spell it in our spelling we may add s but when we say the word plural word of window it sound says windows and that is za sound this is what we are talking about so the last sound was all a vowel sound which means not one of these three safely the plural marker is if a word has one of these sounds plural marker is suck that's all is the plural rules of plurality in English as we know there is not much of a difference between these two a sound vowel sound comes here just to break the continuity of two consonant sounds in a word like jerseys or benches or in some other words also wherever it comes in that is wherever there is not a vowel sound already at the end of the world so if you go back and look at the words it makes sense the last sound of this word book is cup so the plural marker is some last to sound of the word cap is pop so plural marker is so last sound of this word cat is stuff so plural marker can be in a word like cat plural marker could be sup or in a word like window little marker could be za it's windows in a word like bottle take click anywhere computer bottle irrespective of how we write the word with s in computer we add s but it sounds computers bottles take it take any word that comes to your mind Rose so the last sound is Z so here we will need to add a vowel in it to make it sound like roses roses the same thing which we were added in which we were adding in judges or benches so the plural marking is a pretty simple phenomena in English nouns only thing we need to look at is how we speak these things how these words sound and then additionally we need to learn how they are written that's pretty simple so to do this exercise I sincerely request you I urge you to first look at 15 to 20 words that comes to your mind without looking at anything then take a set of nouns let's take a set of 20 words and identify nouns in those 20 words and repeat the same exercise say these words to yourself when they are not pluralized that is say the singular form first identify the last sound in the plural form last sound in the singular form then decide what will be added to these words in in other words when you add plural markers in the words when you have identified the last sounds of the singular words be very sure and comfortable that if the word does not end with Barca only these three sounds then everywhere else you can answer with these sounds you can add some what what's common in these sounds not very important for the purpose of speaking English but when you know about a sound about sounds and commonalities between these sounds you will feel better happier what is common is all these things are all these sounds per the anchor they are coming from three different places of articulations like PAH is a bilabial sound the is an alveolar sound and ker is a velar sound nonetheless all three of them are stop sounds so we will see more importance of these sounds being stopped sounds in English and how they help us observe more patterns later but at this point they help us conclude this discussion on plurality in English very safely and very confidently so do this exercise for yourself add them confidently and try to improve your speech confidently by looking at these patterns so you clearly know what accurately the plural markers are and how accurately those nouns are pronounced when we speak English with that we stop here thank you see you soon
