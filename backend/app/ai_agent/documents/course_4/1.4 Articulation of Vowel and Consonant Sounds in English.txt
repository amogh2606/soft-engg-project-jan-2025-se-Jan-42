[Music] welcome to the class today we will talk about articulation of vowels and consonant sounds as you know vowels are the sounds which are produced with minimum obstruction of the exhaling flow of air in the vocal tract and consonants are the sounds that are produced with different kinds of modifications at different points in vocal tract but with this working understanding of consonants and vowel sounds we want to look at a description of english vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the same time we look at a comparative study comparative understanding of how certain sounds are different in our languages and certain sounds are very specific to english and the way we understand that in order to make our speaking better in order to make changes in the way we speak we need to pay attention to certain sounds to make it impressive and fluent and that is what we are going to look at today so these are we these are some of the vowels some of the fundamental vowel sounds which has three pairs in them and they have long and short alternations like a these are just six fundamental vowel sounds which are which are available in almost all the languages of the world and then you can look at 20 vowel sounds of english in these words and and this is how they are represented uh with fanatic symbol we don't need to pay much attention to phonetic symbols however it is just just good to understand but important point is looking at these words and paying attention to the vowel sounds in these words and we have 20 examples of different vowel sounds in english in different with with example of different words on this screen with you so they are pit pet pat pot butt book mother bean burn and barn just some of them at least 10 examples so where we need to pay attention is in the word pit we have short e pit pit paid pet the vowel sound is a path the vowel sound is thought the vowel vowel sound in this word is o but a short ah in but book shot o mother a sound in this word bean long e burn short o bar ah born so if you if you look at words like fat born you'll you'll see the differences in these vowel sounds and these vowel sounds are specific to english language boon has long o so what what i am trying to tell you is there are lot so we we don't need to look at how these words are written in with their spellings we are looking at how certain sounds work in these words when we speak these words so these are you you can do this exercise for yourself multiple times these are examples of 20 vowel sounds now let's look at this chart this chart doesn't have all 20 vowels in them in it but it has many of them and it is it it's like this picture imagine this whole thing in our mouth and thus you will see then it then then when they say front center and back will make sense so these vowels like e is front wall the vowels here are central vowel and vowels here like back wall similarly according to the tongue height they are close mid and open so so basically this picture gives you distribution of vowel sounds and sort of their places in the vocal tract in the oral cavity now we need to look at certain aspects of consonant sounds before we look at specific details of consonants of english so we understand certain things like there are there are places in our vocal tract which are responsible for different sounds like velum alveolar is teeth and lips so when we have sounds from velum they are called velar sounds sounds from palette they are called palatal sounds sounds from alveolares are called retroflex sounds sounds from teeth are called dental sounds and sounds from lips are called bilabial sounds we have we have looked at some of the examples of these as like example of velar sound chair as an example of palatal sound as an example of retroflex sound as an example of dental sound and pa as an example of labial sound and then we looked at the distinction between oral sounds and nasal sounds at this point i i want to specifically point it to you that there is this entire range of retroflex sounds are not available in english and we will we are going to discuss the implications of this and the the way some of these sounds are produced in english this much of fixing will help us improve speaking to a great extent so before we go to that let's look at let's look at one specific thing so as we know on this vertical axis we we can describe sounds of natural language according to the places from where they originate or places of articulations now if we know so so let me let me describe the following to you if we know ka is a villar sound and kha is a velar sound too ga is a velar sound as well and so is but these four sounds have their own distinctive identity how do we describe the differences between these sounds if we pay attention to two specific features they are going to help us understand the differences between these sounds quite clearly and these differences are so what's the what's what's the difference between ka and ka we see when we speak we have little additional flow of air and this sound says you can you can put your palm right in front of you in front of your mouth and when you when you say the two sounds one after the other you can see additional flow of air as part of blow on your palm that is called aspiration and as i as i want to underline it again the idea of description here is not that you don't know these sounds the idea is to pay attention to the distinction to the differences between these sounds and there is nothing embarrassing about it to do these tests without laboratory for yourself so that you get the differences once for all and then you can evaluate the differences between sounds of the language that you primarily speak and the sounds that you are going to be specifically careful about when we want to improve speaking of english so this additional flow of air this additional flow of air in the form of small little blow is called aspiration so if we make the difference between these two sounds in terms of additional flow of air we see no aspiration with ka which is here indicated as minus aspiration and this one with additional flow is called plus aspiration so this is this this much should be good enough to give us the distinction between these two sounds now how do we make the distinction between ka and ga there is yet another difference between the two and this is quite specific and it is little more difficult to notice than the distinction between ka had additional blow additional flow of air which can be realized externally now let's go back to this picture again and here in within the this glottis you see within this vocal fold folds we have this is vocal fold and this has vocal cords in them for some sounds this code vibrates little more than usual and that vibration is technically understood as voicing so the difference between ka and ga is when we say ka we don't have vocal cords within the vocal folds vibrating additionally whereas cur has little bit more vibration which which is realized as resonance so sometimes if you put your hand in in this area of this this this is the area where we have vocal fold and vocal cord uh and if we put our palm on this and then we say and one after the other then we hear we we feel that resonance on the palm for some it may not be clear but and again you can do this experiment to yourself and and realize it if it doesn't uh if it doesn't become apparent you just need to understand it in the following way in in this particular way to understand the distinction between these two and thus we get the difference between ka and ga so ka is no no vibration so minus voice and ga has vibration so it has class voice so on this axis if you see and if we put these two features together then we can give distinctive identity to these sounds like is no aspiration no voicing is no aspiration aspiration little bit of additional flow of air and no voicing is no aspiration but voicing that is vibration and this sound gha is has both aspiration and vibration thus we see the distinction between all these four oral sounds from one specific place of articulation that is velum these sounds are velar sounds and if we look at these features then we get their identity and thus these 20 20 sounds 20 oral sounds get specific identity so if you say no aspiration and no voicing but from lips that can only be power so labial non-aspirated non-voiced sound it's only one that is power and as as we know these are nasal sounds there are certain specific things that we need to know about nasal sounds which we will discuss at a separate point so now we understand these sounds all these 20 or 24 20 oral and 5 nasal that is 25 sounds are parts of our languages most of them are spoken in india but not all these sounds are available in english like i mentioned the retroflex sounds that is the sounds which come from alveolar reason when the tongue folds backward and tip of the tongue unfolds and hit this alveolar ridge this sound is not available in english so when we go to the english consonant chart and try to look at their places of different places of articulations and we and we try to understand their the the way they are produced that is their manners of articulations then we get this idea that pa and pa are labial sounds and they are both stop but one is non-voiced the other is voiced ma is a nasal sound now here is where here here are the rest of it you can you can figure out i want you to look at carefully is this one specifically we don't have retroflex sounds in english english and are alveolar sounds so let's go back to this picture one more time how do we produce english alveolar sounds tip of the tongue without getting folded and without this folding and unfolding gently touches the alveolar edge and we get to so it's it's not retroflex it's a straight simple alveolar sound without retroflexes flexion for many of us it becomes tough because a close a set of sounds that are very close to our languages are retroflex sound so when we speak english we tend to bring retroflex sounds in our english whereas retroflex sounds are not available in english and this creates a big difference in the way we speak and the way others speak it happens it's not a problem it happens to us because most of our languages have retroflex sounds in them if you are a speaker of individual language like tamil telugu malayalam or kannada they are full of retroflex sounds at the same time if you are speakers of indo-aryan languages like hindi punjabi bhojpuri magahi orea bangla and numerous of them these languages too have a lot of retroflex sounds please take a note here not as many retroflex sounds as we have in dravidian languages but indoor languages do have retroflex sounds so at this point everybody is in the same bracket and because of availability of retroflex sounds in our languages we tend to speak english in a particular way which is sometimes called or most of the time called indian english because one particular feature of indian languages gets in our english at times people do not like the term indian english but trust me there is nothing offensive about it indian variety of english that is the kind of english spoken in different parts of india is named as indian english just as english spoken in america is called american english or english spoken in britain is called british english or english spoken in australia or africa are called african english or australian english just as just like these varieties we have indian variety of english that most of us speak and these are the reasons why our variety has a specific distinction of india in and this is called indian-ness in our english one more time there is nothing bad or offensive about it i want you to understand this in a very clear fashion that this happens to us because we speak our own languages because the vocal tract that we are discussing here matures before 12 years of age and if we learn a language after 12 years then we can still learn we can practice sounds of a new language but we will because our vocal tract has already matured according to the sound patterns of our native languages it doesn't change and therefore we speak the way we speak and thus there is scientific foundation for how and why anyone speaks the way they do and this is the reason why we need to understand it to sound very confident about how we speak having said that it is also possible with regular regular practice to imbibe other sounds certain special sounds of other languages like non-retroflex variety of tear and which are alveolar sounds and the purpose as i mentioned in the beginning the purpose of this description is for us to know the distinction between our ta that is retroflex our ta that is retroflex and english stuff once we know this it's easier for us to work on it and make it sound alveolar when we speak english and may keep it the way when we keep it retroflex when we speak either tamil or hindi or punjabi same way i'll give you one more example please look at this these are two specific sounds in english which are very rarely available in our variety of languages for example hindi the pa sound in hindi which was here which is aspirated non-voiced bilabial per as in pal pool is different from labiodental fur of english as in father french fat friend all these words at the initial position have got a sound fur which is labiodental where we have upper teeth and lower lip coming together and thus we get libya labiodental sounds and this creates the distinction between pa and pha so so the the idea is when you go through the two separate charts of consonant sounds that i have described here with you you can clearly see the difference between certain specific sounds of english and the way we speak certain sounds which may not be available any in english to come to conclusion these are the 24 vowel 24 consonant sounds of english and these 24 words have got 24 consonantal sounds in them which you can practice for yourself when we and and it is important and imperative for us who are trying to improve who are trying to make it sound better it is imperative for us to do this practice to understand the differences between different sounds and to be familiar with 24 consonant sounds of english and 20 vowel sounds of english vis-a-vis the vowel sounds and consonant sounds that we have in our languages while doing so you will also get to underline it for yourself that lot of such consonant and vowel sounds are common as well so do this maths you will come up with a very small set of sounds and working on those sounds make us uh very very it becomes important it becomes clearer to us that if we work on these sounds we can sound the way we want to in english with this we stop here we expect you to do this practice and then we come up with this exercise as well and bring the questions to us which manner which may which may arise out of this and then we will address them thank you so much
