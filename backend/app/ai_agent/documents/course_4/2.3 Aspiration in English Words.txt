[Music] welcome to the class today we are going to talk about aspirations in english words we are going to discuss english words we are going to discuss certain specific features of english words and we are going to see how these features help us improve the way we speak how these features help us sound emphatic how these features how our understanding of these features can improve when we speak english that is english words and english sentences it is important to pay attention to these features as they have tremendous impact on learning how to improve let me get to these features and let you decide how important it is to know about these things we are going to talk about certain underlying features we are going to talk about certain things that are prerequisite for understanding this special aspect of speaking there are three things that we will put together today one is our understanding of syllables we know that english words or for that matter words in many languages can have multiple syllables in them so words have 1 2 3 4 syllables in them there are some words that are possible with 5 6 and 7 syllables as well but beyond 4 the number of syllables you increase in a word the chances of possible possibility of such a word is really very low we have very few words with six seven eight syllables when we say very few words we mean compared to possibility of a word with two three and four syllables so that's that's about celebification so we want to bring in the an idea and our understanding of celebification to understand stress patterns in english language when we mix the two we realize that one of the syllables is more stressed than others that means one of the syllables is more prominent than others in english words with these two we notice yet another thing that we need to pay attention to if we need to improve our speaking and the way we sound a footnote here the more we put an efforts in improving ourselves that adds to our confidence and such confidence such improved improvised confidence makes us sound better and impressive and that is prerequisite for effective communication i keep mentioning this for you to underline this fact that in order to reach the ultimate goal of effective communication we need to look backward and see to to participate in effective communication we need to have good language which is which requires two things it must be flawless that is it must not be ungrammatical we must have grammatical sentences and it must sound proper so fluency and appropriateness correctness they add to the confidence and together it builds effective communication these are components of effective communication so be moving beyond this note to achieve that we need to look at this feature meaning we understand syllables and syllabification we understand how celebification helps us understand stress patterns that is one of the syllables is more prominent and when we put the two together we see that certain sounds in certain syllables are also aspirated we are going to discuss that part today and therefore understanding aspiration and the sounds that can be aspirated or not aspirated requires a good understanding of syllabification and stress patterns in those syllables so we are going to work on these things together let's see how it works take for an example this sentence it's just a sentence that is that i created for impact it's a very simple sentence imperative sentence take a piece of cake take a piece of cake that's how we speak when you hear some others speak this sentence it is possible to say take a piece of cake you don't have to make yourself sound artificial the first step is to understand when some people speak that way why do they speak that way and when we hear them what is it that we need to pay attention to and once we pay attention to that part we know why others do it and we can also improve our own language without understanding the underlying pattern if we try to do that that's called copy and without understanding copying will make you sound ridiculous that's the word which comes to mind so let's look at the underlying pattern what do we see here in this sentence we see that we have we we have three words in this sentence take peace and cake we see that in the first one first sound is ter in the sec in this word first sound is per and in this one this is ka that is ka when we look at it we notice that at initial positions of these words are getting aspirated when we pronounce them this marker small superscript h indicates additional flow of air which marks aspiration so it becomes take peace sounds as peace and cake sounds as cake cake so some people speak english this way that could be british variety of english american variety of english or australian variety of english canadian variety of english and so on they mind it they do have internal variations as well so in indian variety of english we usually don't aspirate these sounds when we do not aspirate these sounds that makes english indian variety that's perfectly fine there is nothing problematic or bad about indian variety of english so understanding this part first makes us understand the distinction between different varieties at least the two and if we want to learn this is what we can learn so let's let's move ahead keep in mind each one of these words like take peace and cake they are monosyllabic words there there is only one syllable in these three words so what we see certain sounds at the word initial position or in these in this case that is for all these three words we can very comfortably say at word initial position or syllable initial position sounds like are getting aspirated that's what is the observation from this let's see these sounds as you know these are it will help you to find out find your understanding about these three english sounds that these are voiceless stop sounds meaning is a bilabial voiceless sound bilabial voiceless and aspirated sound ta is alveolar and aspirated voiceless sound and ka is velar and aspirated voiceless sound each one of them is they form one class which is called because they come from three different places of articulations they do share their features of being voiceless and unaspirated but each but they form a class called stop because in the production of these sounds there is a total blockage at their respective places of articulation and sudden release of the flow of air so they are also called stop sounds so as you see here they are all unaspirated voiceless that is minus voice minus voice minus aspiration at the initial position what we see is it gets aspirated so minus voice becomes plus voice and therefore we were only talking about voiceless stops so look at look at this it becomes it sounds this is an important aspect of english language so look let's let's go back to the basics again and see some of the words in english so what are the word we we have lot of words in english which will either which will begin with either so look at these words like how do we say these words so i'll i'll try to say these words without aspiration they are pen pin pan park this is how we say these words tan truck trick teen car can king crash so you see that at the initial position of each one of these words you have per you have te and you have ka in these three sets you can check the pattern of consonants and vowels in them so what happens is these words when we when we pronounce the initial sounds get aspirated and you can take you can you can write the aspirated sound and these words once once again for your practice they sound like pen pin pan park so the initial sounds in these words are going to be going to get aspirated this is an important rule important things thing to observe in english words so we are we are very much tempted to say that the way it works is stop sounds become aspirated when they occur at the initial position of a word that's what we generalize until this point so we need to know about words and we need to know about sounds and we we observe and we can form this rule that sounds like in english become aspirated at the initial position of words that's what you have seen so far in this discussion but keep in mind this is half of the story when we look at more words and when we bring in words with multiple syllables then we see a slightly different story this still holds true that is do get aspirated in english words but when we bring in slavification that is when we have words with two syllables we see a slightly different story let's look at these words we have words like potato hotel nepal intense intention now look at this each one of these words like this one potato has three syllables in them one two and three in this word hotel one two in this word nepal one two in this word we have two syllables again and in this word we have three syllables that is intention now see what happens here notice that and curve are getting aspirated not at the initial position of the word but they are getting aspirated at the initial position of stressed syllable they get aspirated at the initial position of stressed syllable so the reason why they sound the reason why we have the rule that get aspirated at the initial position of a word is because we were looking at monosyllabic words so when a word is monosyllabic this rule is perfectly fine this rule is still fine that is these sounds do get aspirated but when we have multi-syllable words then these were these sounds get aspirated at the initial position of this trust syllable remember whenever we have two or more than two syllables one of them is going to be stressed and if we have per turka at the syllable initial position at the syllable initial position in the words in in words and if those syllables are stressed then they get aspirated only at the initial position of his trust syllabus so to repeat this part one more and final time in multi-syllable words that is words with at least two and more syllables these were these sounds get stressed only at the initial position of stressed syllables so in this word you see in the first word we see as a sound is there at the syllable initial position but it is not getting aspirated because in the next syllable which is a stressed syllable we have a sound so this sound will get a stress will get aspirated because it's at the initial position of the stressed syllable the question here is can we not apply both the rules together that is if these sounds are there at the initial position of the word they will get aspirated and they will also get aspirated at the initial position of this trust syllable that's not how it works because to aspiration two sounds getting aspirated at two syllables that are one after the other will not be possible will not be easy in speaking therefore that rule doesn't work so we as a result we get words like potato hotel nepal intense intention so these these are in caps stressed syllables and we have ta or pa at the initial position of stressed syllables and therefore we get them aspirated if these sounds are not at the initial position then the even in the even in the stressed syllable if they are not at the initial position they will not get aspirated look at this word deeper here here we have pah but this pa is not at the initial position of this stressed syllable therefore this is not getting aspirated we have insti institute so depending upon i think this is a stressed syllable therefore this will get aspirated if you look at more words then we see like attention i am i'm purposely making it a little more prominent for you to see retain look at this these sounds are getting aspirated retention impossible in a four syllable word this sound is getting aspirated because this syllable is stressed syllable impatient this sound is getting stressed because this syllable is the sound is getting aspirated power in this world because this sound per occurs at the initial position of the syllable that is being stressed department three syllable word pa at the initial position of a stressed syllable competition competition in this word this is the syllable that is getting stressed there is a sound at the initial position of this trust syllable therefore this is getting aspirated decrees occur at the initial position of the stressed syllable hence aspirated decrees now look at it this is a noun in this word this is not the stressed syllable so even though we have a curse sound at the initial position of this syllable it is not getting aspirated because it is not stressed syllable institution institution here ta is at the initial position of the stressed syllable therefore it is aspirated look at here purple here you have per at the initial position of the stress syllable hence aspirated this syllable also has pa at the initial position but since it is not aspirated since it is not stressed this is not aspirated practice here for at the initial position of the stressed syllable hence aspirated the initial position of this syllable but not the stressed one hence not aspirated circle occur at the initial position of this syllable but hence this is not a stressed syllable not aspirated turtle turtle this is a stressed syllable it has the initial position hence aspirated sample this is a stressed syllable not the second one all of these words are two syllable words here stress on the first syllable second syllable is unstressed and unaspirated what what we are trying to show you through these examples that there are pa ta and ka at the syllable initial position in the second syllable but they are not getting aspirated because they are not stressed syllables they are not at the initial position of stress syllables in each one of these words you can see temple at the initial position but only this star gets aspirated because this is at the initial position of the stressed syllable happy look at this you have two pass sound in this word one at the final position of the syllable the other at initial position of the honest syllable hence none of the two gets aspirated so these examples gives you much clearer idea of the point that i am trying to make and you see this and a combined understanding of sounds syllabification in words stress patterns understanding of stress pattern in word they combinely together contribute to our understanding of which sounds which sound gets aspirated at which position in a world and why the same sound doesn't get aspirated at other positions so when we understand this and we would want to practice aspiration in our english it's highly likely that we will get it right and we will we have now in we have now developed capacity in us to practice aspiration in our own english as well and that is not copy look at more second syllable here are stressed and first sounds are aspirated in those so platonic this is aspirated iconic atomic compassion and complete look at this in this word compassion at the initial position in this word complete ka at the initial position but not aspirated because these are not stressed syllables here par at the initial position but not aspirated because it's not at this trust syllable rather you see getting aspirated at the initial position of stressed syllable in the same words most of these words first four words are three-syllable word and last one is two-syllabic word so we get to see these things in more details when we look at words with two syllables three syllables and four syllables forwards so if we form the rule backward like pataka gets aspirated at the initial position of a stressed syllable this applies all right it's just that in monosyllabic word there is no question of stress hence they get aspirated they sound like they are getting aspirated at the initial position of the word that's also initial position of a syllable but there is no question of getting a stressed syllable in monosyllabic word therefore this rule takes precedence over a stress pattern so a clearer understanding takes us in a at a place where we can understand celebrification there are there are points that one can check look at this in monosyllabic words here is how you can do exercises with this thing and pay more attention to these things these are i i come back to this slide one more time these are all monosyllabic words they have pa taka at the initial position of these words hence they are all aspirated and there is no question of prominence of one syllable over the other because there is just one syllable in these words so pathaka will get aspirated now if you notice in a word like park we have ca sound but cursed sound is not getting aspirated because now this is not at the initial position here again you have car sound here you have car sound so you at least there are three examples here where you have cursed sound at non-initial position so aspiration of car is not uniform aspiration of curve only at the initial position of monosyllabic words and initial position of the syllable that is getting stressed in words with two or more syllables pretty simple rule so you can take word words like school why is this word important it has school it has school you have a sound curve but remember this is not at the initial position so it will sound as school school but if you had a word like cool then for some speakers of english this will get aspirated cool cool and that's the reason why that's how aspiration works for native speakers of english this is why this is more intuitive to those who speak english as their first language many of us do speak english as many of us do sound as english as our first language but keep in mind that english is also indian variety of english so if we want to pay atten if we want to sound like british speakers or american speakers or we want to make our english more impressive and if we understand these patterns we are going to learn this once for all and not just we learn to do that not just we compel ourselves to practice we com we work on this practice with a proper understanding of underlying patterns that work in the language therefore again as key point understanding underlying patterns of language in particular english in this case english is going to be key in helping us enhance and improve our language that has impact on our subconscious which gives us fluency appropriateness and accuracy they build our confidence and we do effective communication without flaws with these with these things so we work on these parts we become much better we look forward to your questions we i wish i suggest you do some practices of these things and check yourself check some some words sounds and see if these rules work do you find examples where we break these rules we are looking forward to a discussion on these things with you with that thank you so much
