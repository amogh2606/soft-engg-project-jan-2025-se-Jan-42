[Music] welcome to the class today we will talk about sounds of english we are going to talk about writing system in english these are the two separate things and right at the outset that is right at the beginning of this class i would like to tell you to pay attention to these things carefully in order to learn different aspects of english language it is important to separate these two once again we are talking about writing system in english and sound system of english if we try to simplify it further we are going to be talking about how we spell things that is writing system and what happens when we speak are these two things different if it is surprising to you then you require even closer attention to these facts they are very different things speaking is contingent upon sound system and writing particularly in english has a different system that is we follow we have different cis different symbols to represent sounds of english we are going to elaborate on that today as a note as a footnote to this let me also add to you that learning to write is one of the skills that we can learn by putting in efforts but learning to speak particularly for children is quite intuitive and once we pay attention to these things things become easier for us to learn let's move ahead and talk about it one more disclosure right at the beginning we are going to be talking about writing system and sound system we we don't intend or we don't employ that we are going to begin teaching you alphabets we understand that you know language and almost all of you are at many different levels in the process of learning through these things we are trying to work on something we are trying to draw your attention to something that is rarely paid attention to in the process of learning so let me talk about let me talk more about it when we move further so one more time learning to speak and learning to write and we are going to look at these things for the purpose of learning english when you when you learnt english alphabet for the first time i am sure you have paid attention to this but i want to draw your attention to more questions and then going to invite you to check if these questions came to your mind i am sure what you see on the screen is familiar to you these are 26 symbols of english writing system we depending upon when we started to learn english writing system we have to learn this thing first so and and these these things are taught in different ways whatever method you you applied to learn these things you have learnt these 26 letters they are a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y and z right from this point uh when we the the last part when we some people say this as g some people say as said the difference is between british and american spoken system in american system this is known as z in a british british system this is known as zet that's how we irrespective of the method applied in learning we learn these things then you must have learned the second set as well set one and set two the difference between these two sets is one is called upper case and the other is called lower case so uppercase symbols and lowercase symbols i i do not mean anything else when i say symbols i know they are alphabets and they are used in writing system but the reason why i am calling them symbols again and again is very simple and i want you to know that the reason is we use these symbols to represent sounds that we speak and we will dwell upon that when we move further but let's stick to the other question and for the time being and here is what i am inviting you to think why do we have two different sets why do we have upper case symbols and lowercase symbols i know one answer is very simple we use uppercase in the beginning of a word when those words are used in a sentence we used the upper case only at the first at the initial position of the first word in the sentence and then there are lot of words which begin with upper case we use upper cases in abbreviations and so on we know that's not my question my question is couldn't we have just one what difference would it make why do we need two different sets think about it not sure we have an answer to this question have you found an answer to this question for yourself so far please look at that try to find an answer for yourself this is just an interesting thing this doesn't have much to do with learning part nonetheless whether or not we have an answer to the question we know that we are we have two different sets and we use them in a ah we we know how to use them so like i said upper case like one of them at the initial position of a word and at several words within a sentence also but not every word within a sentence begins with uppercase so most often proper names are for proper names the initiate initial position we use uppercase like names etc we we were talking a minute ago we were talking about learnings learning different methods of learning ah we some people learn it through rhymes they they have for particularly for kids there are a lot of lines designed so that it sounds like sounds little melodious musical and becomes easy for children to memorize them and at the next stage of learning is they give they they give words like a for apple b for ball c for cat d for dog e for elephant f for fan g for girl h for house i for inc etc i remembered the other ones too but i have purposely left them blank because i want you to test your own understanding of learning alphabet at the initial point and see if you can fill up the rest of it now so the first first thing is ah learning the whole symbol through rhymes and then giving examples of those lines so that these are the two different stages then i asked you a question why two different sets like why uppercase and lowercase you are already going to you are going to think about that now here is another ah another question and with that question we begin our discussion in more serious sense when we say a for apple what do we mean say the word apple for yourself and see if you hear a in that apple apple where do we hear a in that there is no a sound in the word apple this is a disconnect so what we basically mean and let me underline this again i am not trying to make fun of it by drawing your attention to this neither i am trying to ridicule the sense employed within this process what i am trying to tell you is when we teach kids and when kids memorize these things as a for apple b for ball c for cat d for dog etcetera etcetera what what happens in that is they are they are trying to learn or they are the purpose is to teach them writing system what is the writing system in the word apple the first letter is a in the in the word ball the first letter is b that's how that is the reason why we say a for apple or a as in apple b as in ball c as in cat so we mean the first symbol first letter in the writing of the word cat is c because there is no sound as k no sound as c in the word cat what is the first sound in the word cat which is represented with c that sound is k so what are the sounds in this world i'm purposely taking this monosyllabic one small word so the word begins with k sound but we write in the when we write the word cat at the initial position we write c so and if you if you look at all of them i have i have given you just few examples of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 words in each one of them there is no a sound in the word apple no b sound there is no b sound no c sound no d sound in the word elephant look at elephant do we have e it's a elephant f there is no f sound because the sound is power the form the sound is for fan fine girl g the sound is g house begins with h the sound is ha so if you if you pay attention to me many words in english you will realize that the way we speak a word is different from the way we write in the sense that there is no direct one-to-one correspondence between the sound system of english that is the way words are spoken and the way it is written with the symbols representing those sounds this makes the learning little more difficult so but my purpose of this the purpose of discussing this for you here is not to not to show you difficulty my purpose is to draw your attention to this and please remember a key word here paying attention please keep paying attention to differences in similarities and the points where we are trying to draw your attention uh an effort in looking at underlying pattern and an effort in paying attention to these things will take you several steps ahead learning as you know is subconscious process by paying attention to these things they this effort will fix several things in your subconscious and then you will sound more confident so first step is to pay attention the second step is to allow these things to function your subconscious to fix some of them and then third step is to observe your own output whether your learning has whether your output has impact of your learning or not watch yourself through this process and you will see the results coming out that is results of your efforts coming out in your performance that's a note on learning but so so the idea is not to show you difficulties the idea is not to show you problems but the idea is to bring your attention to this point point is there is a disconnect between the two not a big problem but we we pay attention to this and through that we learn we give priority to learning sounds and i'm going to show you these things further and then then it will have an impact on learning we will also talk about sounds to see the differences between that is our effort in paying attention to sound system of english will also help us pay attention to how english sounds are different from sounds in the language that we primarily speak and that difference that understanding is going to sort them out vividly clearly and it will have impact on your learning so this is what you have seen ah this is just a ah just another table of uppercase and lowercase symbols so we use only these 26 letters to represent all sounds of english we are going to talk about all of them we are going to talk about each one of them and then we are going to find them in different words and you will see how they help you learn to speak they help they help you learn to write and they help you feel more confident in writing reading and speaking and and also in various different aspects various different stages of your learning english so here is here is one more time i want your attention i like this table and therefore i brought this for you so this is uppercase this is lowercase uppercase lowercase and this is english this is this is a spelling of these letters that is how these when we say be how it sounds and in this one you have been given a phonetic transcription of sounds involved so so pay attention to that so here is one so you will understand why i have put this square brackets the first letter is a how do we read it a so b ba and long e so the letter the pronunciation of the letter itself has at least two sounds in in it that is ba and long e same thing with c sir and long e c so look at this it b c d e f g h h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w look at this word this sound w the the the pronunciation of this one symbol involves sounds which is like a word x y z or z as i said you can see here z so this chart helps you see the sounds involved in pronouncing these symbols that is names of these symbols a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y and z one more time take any word any any one of these letters and see like t tur so they sound like a word and when we learn them memorize them that's how we say these symbols now so that that's about writing i i at this point when i am talking about the difference between writing and speech sounds i am going to draw another distinction ah and we will come back to these consonants and vowels again but it is important to mention them right at this at this point so when we when we learn how many vowels are there in english language quite often you will find people say 5 and they are a e i o u a e i o u a e i o u so these are lower case these are uppercase what we and that's not wrong what we mean in that is some of these symbols represent vowel sounds that's another thing which i want you to pay attention to some of these these five symbols represent vowel sounds in english writing system however when we look at vocalic sounds vowel sounds so so all the sounds are classified in two categories one is consonants and the other is vowel the reason why we are talking about vowels first is because vowels are more fundamental to natural language and you will see the meaning of more fundamental being more fundamental to natural language when we move on further so here we have this chart gives you an example of 20 vowel sounds in english language 20 vowel sounds in english language and this chart also gives you an example of a word where they occur so look at this look at some of them at least pit it has a vowel e short e pet and these sounds are underlined in these words pat burn burn born boone bite bait boy toe house poor ear air these are 20 vowel sounds in english language please look at this chart this uh these examples carefully and read them several times these examples pay attention to these sounds in these words what it will do is it will get you think about vowel sounds in remaining words that you know vowel sounds in other words that you will speak other than these what you must also do is find another five words at least for each one of these vowel sounds so that means you i'm asking you to make a list of hundred english words where five five examples for each one of these vowel sounds you don't have to do that in one go you don't have to do that in one day but if you can come up with a set of 20 words 20 different words five times for each one of these 20 vowels you'll get an idea of how vowel sounds work if five sets sound too much start with one and then try to pay attention to words that we write or speak what are the vowels involved in those words it it will be quite an exercise and will have serious impact on how we understand vowel system vowel sounds of english language one more time to underline this thing all these vowel sounds are all these vowel sounds become clearer in the words and not we are not talking about again spelling that is the way we write words we are talking about sounds the way we speak same way there are 24 consonant sounds in english and this chart gives you example of each one of them in with with a within a word so some of the words are repeated and those sounds are those vowels those consonant sounds are given in capital so what what we are doing here is like pit the sound is pa we we want your attention to sound per bit attention to to sound ba tap attention to sound dab attention to sound da cab attention to sound ka gab attention to sound ga fan attention to sound van sad zoo man not hot lad red red thought them shy treasure shine jam yum sing so in the words thing we want your attention to sound so these are 20 consonant sounds in english one more time i want to repeat myself and i mean that is it possible for you to find at least five set of words with these sounds it should be easier with consonants please pay attention to them please do this exercise for yourself and once you have these sets ready the only thing you will need to do afterwards or you will end up doing afterwards is every word that you have not not in formal writing or speaking not every moment every time but in in your subconscious many times you will end up finding consonants and vowel sounds in the words that you speak and that's a very productive exercise to do so with that we are talking about 24 plus 20 that is 44 sounds of english language remember there are only 44 sounds in english language and these are the 44 sounds that are responsible for infinite number of words that we make using these sounds we speak infinite number of words using these sounds and i mean infinite in the sense that nobody knows total number of words in any given language do you know about total number of words either in english or in the language that you speak as your primary language as your native language do you know the total number of words so how and why a finite set of 44 odd sounds are responsible for infinite set of words in any spoken language of the world including english is no less than miracle we will continue talking about some of them for the purpose of learning english this is this is a promise so one more time this is yet another table where 24 vowel sounds underlined colored uh with their phonetic transcriptions like pin bad thin dog five van thin that man knows thing half church jam kind gun say zoo ship measure leg run work yes sir 24 sound and then you have again some examples here and finally finally ah i know i have talked about too many exercises for one day but they are they are not too difficult exercises ah we will we will stop for today by telling you one more time you do not have to do all these things in one go but for the purpose of learning for the purpose of checking whether the things that we have discussed that is writing using symbols as a completely different exercise than understanding sounds of the language when we speak they are two different things sounds are definitely represented using 44 sounds are represented using 26 symbols in for the purpose of writing that itself is a complex process which we go through and learn but paying attention paying close attention to this these 44 sounds of english is going to improve the way we are going to speak or when you are when you are speaking its going to help you improve your speaking better thank you
